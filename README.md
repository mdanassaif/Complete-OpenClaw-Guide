# OpenClaw Guide

A single-page HTML guide for setting up and automating OpenClaw (local + VPS). Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts; icons are embedded inline as SVG.

## View

Open `openclaw-guide-v3.html` in your browser (double-click or `open openclaw-guide-v3.html` on macOS). No build step needed.

## Edit

All styling and markup live in the same file. Keep changes ASCII-only and reuse the existing SVG icon sprite for consistency.
