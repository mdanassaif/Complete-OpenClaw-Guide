# OpenClaw Guide

Single-page HTML guide for setting up and automating OpenClaw (local + VPS). Fonts load from Google Fonts; icons are embedded inline as SVG.

## View locally

Open `openclaw-guide-v3.html` (or `index.html`) in your browser (double-click or `open openclaw-guide-v3.html` on macOS). No build step needed.

## Deploy (Vercel static)

Vercel serves `index.html` by default. A copy of the guide is placed at `index.html` for that purpose. If you add pages, keep an `index.html` at the root or configure `vercel.json` rewrites.

## Edit

Everything lives in one file. Keep edits ASCII-only and reuse the existing SVG icon sprite to stay consistent.
